IterOptBSREL is a set of batch files for use with HyPhy

The primary batch file is AddRateClass.bf, the AddRate2Branch function in
which will add a single rate class to a single branch and properly create a
new Likelihood Function for further optimization.

The model_test.bf file is a script for testing the features of
AddRateClass.bf. It will also serve as a usage exmaple. Future users should
focus on incorporating the functions in AddRateClass.bf, not using
model_test.bf directly.

Simplex1Seq_reduced.nex is a test data file.

tutorial.txt is a collection of HBL oddities for future reference.
